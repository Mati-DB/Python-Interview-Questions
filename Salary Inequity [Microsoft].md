## Interview Question
Given a list of salaries, we'll define a metric called inequity which is the difference between max and min salary seen in the list:

```inequity = max(input_list) − min(input_list)```

Write a function called ```min_inequity``` which takes in a list of salaries, and ```a``` value ```n```, and returns the **minimum** inequity possible when taking ```n``` salaries from the full salary list.

If that was hard to understand, you're not alone – let's break it down with some examples.

**Example #1:**
```salaries = [60000, 80000, 120000, 70000]```

```n = 2```

The minimum inequity is $10,000, because 𝑚𝑎𝑥(60000,70000) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(60000,70000) = 10000

**Example #2:**

```salaries = [60000, 80000, 120000, 70000]```

```n = 3```

The minimum inequity is $20,000, because 𝑚𝑎𝑥(60000,70000,80000) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(60000,70000,80000) = 20000
